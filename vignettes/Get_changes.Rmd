**Helper functions.**

- `stockr::get_currencies()` return a list of currencies symbols and names. This is helpful to understand the currencies symbols of the Yahoo Finance API, such as the `currency` column of the `data.frame` returned by `stockr::get_historic`. 

- `stockr::get_changes(from = "USD", to = "EUR")` compute changes with the latest exchange rate, given currencies symbols.


```{r currencies}
library(stockr)
# If you need to understand a currency symbol :
currencies <- get_currencies(keep = c("RON",  "USD") )
currencies
```


```{r changes}

changes <- get_changes(from = c("RON", "USD"), to = "EUR")

# print the exchange rate :
knitr::kable(caption = "1 Romanian Leu and 1 US$ on the currency market (â‚¬)"
,  align = 'c', changes[, c("from", "to", "regularmarketprice","date")])

```

<!-- --- -->
<!-- **Technical details.** `stockr::get_changes()` behavior is similar to `paste(from, to, "-X")`. Thus : -->

<!-- - it's fine to convert several value into *one* other values, and vice-versa ; -->
<!-- - it's fine to convert a list of paired values ; -->
<!-- - 2 list of different lengths will lead to messy results. -->
